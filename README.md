My configs and scripts
======================
This repository is a collection of configurations that I use on my systems to make my life easier. Below is a brief description of some of the tools that I use in the hope that someone else might find this useful.

bspwm
-----
This is a fantastic tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. My scripts for bspwm supports multiple monitors and can scale very easily.

vim
---
Using the vim text editor with a couple of plugins it can make anyone look like a pro. Here is a couple of plugins that I find very useful.

1. Vungle: Used to manage plugins in Vim
2. Ultisnips: Is the ultimate solution for snippets in Vim
3. Vim-snippets: Contains snippets files for various programming languages
4. YouCompleteMe: Is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for Vim
5. Nerdcommenter: Allows for easy commenting of code for many file types
6. Vim-airline: Is a lean status/tabline for vim
7. Jellbeans: It is a dark yet colourful colour scheme

To setup Vim on your system with my configuration please run the following command to install vundle on your system.

```git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim```

Once that is done you can proceed to execute vim. With Vim now open type ":PluginInstall" without quotes and press return. This will take awhile to complete.
