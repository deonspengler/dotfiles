My configs
==========
This repository is a collection of configurations that I use on my systems to make my life easier. Below is a brief description of some of the tools that I use in the hope that someone else might find this useful.

Vim
---
Vim is a fantastic text editor and with a few plugins it can make anyone look like a pro. Here is a couple of plugins that I find very useful.

1. Vungle: Used to manage plugins in Vim
2. Ultisnips: Is the ultimate solution for snippets in Vim
3. Vim-snippets: Contains snippets files for various programming languages
4. YouCompleteMe: Is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for Vim
5. Nerdcommenter: Allows for easy commenting of code for many file types
6. Vim-airline: Is a lean status/tabline for vim
7. Jellbeans: It is a dark yet colourful colour scheme  

To setup Vim on your system with my configuration please run the following command to install vundle on your system.

```git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim```

Once that is done you need to copy the .vimrc file from this repository to your home folder and then you can proceed to execute vim. With Vim now open type ":PluginInstall" without quotes and press return. This will take awhile to complete
